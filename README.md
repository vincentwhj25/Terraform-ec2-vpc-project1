# Terraform Project 1: VPC and EC2 Deployment

This project demonstrates the use of Terraform to provision a basic AWS environment.  
It creates:
- custom VPC
- public subnet
- security group allowing SSH
- EC2 instance running Amazon Linux

## Future Improvements
- Add Key Pair for SSH access
- Add Internet Gateway and Route Table
- Use modules for better organization
